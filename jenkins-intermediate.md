## Challenge #1: deploying a Jenkins server to use for this course. 

- Challenge: https://github.com/agcdtmr/essential-jenkins-2468076/tree/main/Ch01/01_02-challenge-deploy-a-jenkins-server
- Solution: https://github.com/agcdtmr/automation/tree/main/jenkins-intermediate/challenge01

Requirements for this challenge:
- [x] Use the latest version of Ubuntu Server. 
- [x] Install NGINX as a proxy to Jenkins. 
- [x] Install and configure Jenkins. 
- [x] use a public cloud service for this challenge.

For my solution:
- [x] I used Microsoft Azure
- [x] Linux (ubuntu 20.04), Standard B1s (1 vcpu, 1 GiB memory), 20.4.1.111
- [x] DNS: jenk.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com
- [x] creates ssh key pair and public as .pem file
- [x] location: West Europe
- [x] nginx version: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
- [x] jenkins -version 2.428
- [x] security rules for: ssh 22 (to connect to the server), http 80 (to connect github and jenkins via a web interface)
- [x] uses user data script to install nginx & jenkins


The main reason to use a cloud service is so your Jenkins is accessible from a public URL. In later lessons, we'll be implementing continuous integration from a code repo, and your Jenkins server needs to be publicly accessible to allow a web hook to trigger jobs. 


## Challenge #2: Develop a parameterized pipeline.

- Challenge: https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/essential-jenkins-2468076/tree/main/Ch02/02_07-challenge-develop-a-parameterized-pipeline

pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        choice(name: 'ENVIRONMENT',
        choices: ['DEVELOPMENT', 'STAGING', 'PRODUCTION'],
        description: 'Choose the environment for this deployment')
        
        password(name: 'APIKEY',
        description: 'Passes a secret value into the pipeline',
        defaultValue: '123ABC')

    }
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo "This step tests the project"
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            when {
                expression {
                    params.ENVIRONMENT == "PRODUCTION"
                }
            }
            steps {
                echo "This stage deploys the project"
            }
        }
        stage('Report') {
            steps {
                echo "This stage generates a report"
                sh "printf \"${params.CHANGELOG}\" > ${params.ENVIRONMENT}.txt"
                archiveArtifacts allowEmptyArchive: true, 
                    artifacts: '*.txt', 
                    fingerprint: true, 
                    followSymlinks: false, 
                    onlyIfSuccessful: true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Error fixing: To connect to an Ubuntu virtual machine (VM) in Azure using SSH and a `.pem` file, you can follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Azure VM**:
   Ensure you have created an Ubuntu VM in Azure and have downloaded the `.pem` private key file during the VM creation process.

2. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**:
   Open your local terminal or command prompt. If you're using Windows, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or an SSH client like PuTTY.

3. **Set Permissions for the `.pem` File**:
   Make sure the `.pem` file is protected and only readable by you. You can use the `chmod` command on Linux/Mac or simply adjust file properties on Windows.

   ```bash
   chmod 400 /path/to/your/ssh.pem
   ```

4. **SSH into the Azure VM**:
   Use the `ssh` command to connect to your VM. The command will typically look like this:

   ```bash
   ssh -i /path/to/your/ssh.pem username@azure-vm-public-ip
   ```

   - Replace `/path/to/your/ssh.pem` with the full path to your `.pem` file.
   - Replace `username` with the username you created when setting up your Azure VM.
   - Replace `azure-vm-public-ip` with the public IP address or hostname of your Azure VM.

   For example, if your username is "azureuser" and the public IP is "123.45.67.89," the command might look like:

   ```bash
   ssh -i /path/to/your/ssh.pem azureuser@123.45.67.89
   ```

5. **Enter the Passphrase (if Applicable)**:
   If your private key is protected with a passphrase, you'll be prompted to enter it.

6. **You're Now Connected**:
   You should now be connected to your Azure VM via SSH. You can execute commands on the VM through the terminal. When you're finished, simply type `exit` to disconnect.

Please note that the exact commands and filenames may vary depending on your specific setup and file locations. Make sure to replace placeholders with your actual file paths and credentials.

Additionally, ensure that your Azure VM's network security group allows incoming SSH traffic on port 22, and that the VM is running and reachable with the provided public IP address or DNS hostname.

---

### Error fixing: a virtual machine (VM) running Jenkins and Nginx on Azure, and experiencing issues with DNS or the public IP not working in a browser.s 

**Solution: Adjust NSG or firewall inbound rules for http & https**

Here are some common troubleshooting steps to help you identify and resolve the issue:

1. **Check VM Status:** Ensure that your Azure VM is running and in a healthy state. If it's not running, start the VM from the Azure Portal.

2. **Security Group Rules:** Verify that your Azure Network Security Group (NSG) or firewall rules allow incoming traffic on the necessary ports (e.g., port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS). You need to open these ports to allow web traffic to your VM. Check the NSG rules associated with your VM's network interface.

3. **DNS Configuration:** Confirm that your DNS records are correctly configured. If you are using a custom domain, make sure the DNS records (A records or CNAME records) point to the correct public IP address or DNS name associated with your Azure VM.

4. **Public IP Configuration:** Check that the public IP address associated with your VM is correctly assigned and not in a "Reserve" state.

5. **Web Server Configuration:** Ensure that both Jenkins and Nginx are properly configured and running on your VM. Test each service individually by accessing them via their respective ports (e.g., Jenkins on port 8080, Nginx on port 80). Make sure there are no errors in the service configurations.

6. **Firewall Inside VM:** Check the firewall settings inside the VM. Ensure that there are no software firewalls (like UFW on Linux) blocking incoming traffic on the required ports. You may need to adjust firewall rules within the VM.

7. **Nginx Configuration:** If you're using Nginx as a reverse proxy, verify that the Nginx configuration is correctly set up to forward incoming HTTP requests to the Jenkins service. The Nginx server block (virtual host) should be properly configured.

8. **Browser Cache:** Clear your browser cache and try accessing the site again. Sometimes, cached data can interfere with the loading of a website.

9. **Test with IP Address:** If DNS issues persist, try accessing your site directly using the public IP address rather than the domain name. This will help you determine if the issue is DNS-related.

10. **Azure Diagnostics:** Check Azure's diagnostics and monitoring tools for any specific errors or issues related to your VM, public IP, or network configurations.

11. **Logs and Error Messages:** Examine the logs and error messages on your VM, Jenkins, and Nginx for any clues as to what might be causing the issue. These logs can provide valuable information for troubleshooting.

### Bash script for automating the installation and configuration of various software components and services. Here's a short explanation of what's happening in the script:

1. The script begins with a comment and an echo statement to indicate that the installation is starting.

2. It adds the Jenkins package repository key to the system's keyring and sets up the Jenkins repository in the APT sources list.

3. Then, it updates the APT package list and upgrades installed packages.

4. It installs several packages, including Java 11, NGINX, and Jenkins, which are common components for setting up a Jenkins server.

5. The script configures Jenkins by setting options to skip the installation wizard and downloading a list of suggested plugins.

6. It downloads a plugin installation tool, runs it to install the suggested plugins, and changes the ownership of the plugin directory to the Jenkins user.

7. NGINX is configured to act as a reverse proxy for Jenkins, with a new server block defined to pass requests to the Jenkins server.

8. The script reloads NGINX to apply the new configuration.

9. Docker is installed, with the script adding the Docker repository key and setting up the Docker repository in the APT sources list. Docker and related packages are then installed.

10. The Docker and Containerd services are enabled, and the script adds the "ubuntu" and "jenkins" users to the "docker" group.

11. Jenkins is restarted to apply any changes, and the script copies the initial admin password for Jenkins.

12. The script clears the terminal, displays a message that the installation is complete, and provides the initial credentials (username: admin, password: generated during Jenkins setup).

In summary, the script automates the installation and configuration of Jenkins, NGINX, Java, and Docker on a server, making it easier to set up a Jenkins server for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) purposes.

### What is apt and apt package list?

`apt` stands for "Advanced Package Tool," and it is a package management system used in various Linux distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivatives. `apt` is a command-line tool that allows users to interact with the system's package repositories to install, update, upgrade, and manage software packages.

Here are some common `apt` commands:

1. `apt update`: This command refreshes the local package database by downloading the latest package information from the configured software repositories. It ensures that your system is aware of the most up-to-date package versions available.

2. `apt upgrade`: This command installs the latest versions of all installed packages on your system. It doesn't install new packages or remove any existing ones.

3. `apt-get install <package-name>`: This command is used to install a specific package or packages on your system.

4. `apt-get remove <package-name>`: This command is used to remove a specific package from your system.

5. `apt-get purge <package-name>`: This command is used to remove a package along with its configuration files.

6. `apt list`: This command lists all available packages in the repositories.

7. `apt search <search-term>`: This command allows you to search for packages based on a keyword or search term.

The "APT package list" typically refers to the list of available software packages in the repositories that `apt` uses to manage packages on your system. When you run `apt update`, it downloads and updates this package list to ensure that your system has the latest information about available software packages. This list includes package names, versions, dependencies, and other metadata necessary for package management.

By keeping the APT package list up to date, you can ensure that you are installing and updating software with the most current versions and that you have access to the latest security updates and bug fixes.

---

### Docker is included in the script provided for several reasons:

1. **Isolation of Jenkins and its Dependencies:** Docker provides a way to isolate Jenkins and its dependencies in a container. This isolation ensures that Jenkins runs consistently, regardless of the underlying system's configuration. It helps prevent conflicts between Jenkins and other software installed on the server.

2. **Ease of Deployment:** Using Docker makes it easy to deploy Jenkins as a containerized application. You can package Jenkins and its required components in a Docker image, making it simple to replicate the same environment on different servers or in different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).

3. **Portability:** Docker containers are highly portable. You can move a Jenkins Docker container between different hosts or cloud platforms without worrying about compatibility issues. This portability is especially valuable in cloud and DevOps environments.

4. **Version Control and Rollbacks:** Docker images can be version-controlled, allowing you to track changes to your Jenkins environment over time. If an update or configuration change causes issues, you can roll back to a previous image.

5. **Consistency:** Docker containers ensure that Jenkins runs consistently across different stages of the software development and deployment lifecycle, which is crucial for maintaining a reliable CI/CD pipeline.

6. **Resource Management:** Docker provides resource management and scaling capabilities, allowing you to allocate specific resources to Jenkins containers, which can help optimize the performance of your Jenkins server.

In summary, Docker is used in the script to containerize Jenkins, making it easier to manage, deploy, and ensure consistent performance of Jenkins within the context of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. It's a common practice to use Docker for CI/CD environments to maintain a high degree of flexibility, portability, and ease of management.

### What is `source install.sh`?

The command `source install.sh` is used to execute a shell script in the current shell environment. When you use the `source` command or its shorthand `.` (dot), it reads and executes the commands from the specified script (in this case, `install.sh`) in the context of the current shell session. This means that any environment variables, functions, or changes made by the script will affect the current shell session.

Here's how it works:

1. You run the command `source install.sh` or `. install.sh` in your terminal.

2. The contents of the `install.sh` script are executed as if you had typed them directly into your terminal.

3. Any environment variables, functions, or other changes made by the script are applied to your current shell session.

This is commonly used when you want to set environment variables, modify the shell's behavior, or perform other tasks that need to persist in your current shell session. For example, if `install.sh` contains environment variable assignments, they will be available in your current shell after running the command.

Keep in mind that the script `install.sh` should be in your current working directory or specified with its full path if it's located elsewhere. Additionally, ensure that the script is executable (use `chmod +x install.sh` to make it executable if needed).

### What is http?

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is an application layer protocol used for transmitting and receiving data on the World Wide Web. HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the internet, allowing web browsers and web servers to communicate with each other. Here are some key points about HTTP:

1. **Client-Server Communication:** HTTP is a request-response protocol. A client (typically a web browser) sends a request to a web server, and the server responds with the requested data (usually a web page or a resource like an image).

2. **Stateless:** HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that each request from a client to a server is treated independently, and the server does not maintain any information about previous requests. To implement sessions and maintain state, web applications often use cookies or other mechanisms.

3. **Text-Based:** HTTP messages are primarily text-based, making them human-readable. These messages include headers and, optionally, a message body. The headers contain metadata about the request or response, while the message body may contain the actual data being transferred.

4. **Standard Methods:** HTTP defines a set of methods, also known as verbs, for indicating the desired action to be performed on the resource identified in the request. Common HTTP methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (send data to be processed), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data), and others.

5. **Status Codes:** HTTP responses include status codes that provide information about the outcome of the request. For example, a "200 OK" status code indicates a successful request, while a "404 Not Found" status code indicates that the requested resource was not found.

6. **URLs:** HTTP uses Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to identify resources on the web. A URL typically consists of a protocol (e.g., "http" or "https"), a domain name (e.g., www.example.com), and a path to the specific resource (e.g., /index.html).

7. **HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2:** There have been several versions of the HTTP protocol. HTTP/1.1 was widely used for many years, but HTTP/2 and later versions were developed to improve performance and security, enabling features like multiplexing and reduced latency.

8. **Security:** HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data transferred between the client and server using protocols like SSL/TLS. It ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data and is commonly used for sensitive transactions like online shopping and banking.

HTTP is the backbone of the World Wide Web, allowing users to access and interact with web content. It is a fundamental technology that enables the retrieval and display of web pages and the exchange of data between clients and servers on the internet.

---

### Why http is port 80?

HTTP uses port 80 as its default port for communication, while HTTPS (HTTP Secure) typically uses port 443. The assignment of port numbers for various protocols is defined by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to ensure consistency and compatibility in network communication. Port numbers are used to specify which protocol should handle incoming network data.

The choice of port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS is a convention and simplifies the process of routing web traffic on the internet. When a client (e.g., a web browser) makes an HTTP request, it typically assumes that the server it's communicating with is listening on port 80, and when it makes an HTTPS request, it assumes port 443.

These conventions make it easier for routers, firewalls, and other network devices to direct traffic to the appropriate destination. When you enter a URL in your web browser, it typically doesn't include a port number. If the URL is "http://example.com," the browser assumes port 80, and if it's "https://example.com," it assumes port 443.

It's important to note that while port 80 and port 443 are the default ports for HTTP and HTTPS, respectively, web servers can be configured to use other ports if necessary. However, for standard web traffic, these default port numbers simplify the process of establishing connections between clients and servers.

### what is ssh and rsa and ed25591?

SSH (Secure Shell) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) are both related to secure communication and authentication in the context of remote access and data transfer over a network. ED25519 is a specific digital signature algorithm used in SSH for authentication.

1. **SSH (Secure Shell)**:
   - SSH is a network protocol used to secure and encrypt data communication between two devices. It is commonly used for remote login and secure file transfer, among other purposes.
   - SSH provides a secure and encrypted way to access and manage remote systems over an unsecured network, such as the internet.

2. **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**:
   - RSA is a widely-used cryptographic algorithm that is used for secure data transmission and authentication. It was invented by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in the 1970s.
   - In the context of SSH, RSA is used for authentication. RSA key pairs consist of a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt data, and the private key is used to decrypt it. It is often used in SSH for secure passwordless logins.

3. **ED25519**:
   - ED25519 is a specific elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (EdDSA) that is used in SSH for authentication purposes.
   - It is considered more secure and efficient than some older algorithms like DSA or ECDSA. ED25519 keys are shorter and faster to generate than RSA keys while providing a high level of security.
   - Many modern SSH implementations encourage the use of ED25519 for key pairs to enhance security.

In the context of SSH, RSA and ED25519 are key types that can be used for authentication. When you connect to a remote server using SSH, you can choose to use an RSA key or an ED25519 key for authentication. These keys are more secure than traditional password-based authentication, as they provide a strong cryptographic layer for securing the communication between your local and remote systems.

---

### What is `ssh -i`?

The `ssh -i` command is used to specify an identity file (private key) when connecting to a remote server using SSH. The private key is used for authentication, allowing you to establish a secure connection without entering a password. Here's how you typically use the `ssh -i` command:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/private-key-file username@hostname
```

- `-i`: This option specifies the path to the private key file. The private key file should be in the OpenSSH format, usually ending with `.pem` or no file extension.

- `/path/to/private-key-file`: Replace this with the actual file path to your private key.

- `username`: The username you use to log in to the remote server.

- `hostname`: The hostname or IP address of the remote server you want to connect to.

Here's an example of how you might use it:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/my_private_key.pem user@example.com
```

This command will initiate an SSH connection to the remote server with the specified private key for authentication. It's a more secure and convenient way to log in compared to using a password, especially in automated or script-driven tasks.

---

### What is a pipeline syntax generator?

A pipeline syntax generator is a tool or software component designed to assist in the creation and configuration of pipeline scripts, particularly in the context of continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. These tools are often used in conjunction with pipeline orchestration and automation systems like Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, and others. **The primary purpose of a pipeline syntax generator is to simplify the process of writing pipeline configuration files by providing a user-friendly interface and generating the necessary script or code.**

Key features and functionalities of a pipeline syntax generator typically include:

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** Pipeline syntax generators often offer graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that make it easier for developers and DevOps engineers to define the various stages, steps, and configurations of a CI/CD pipeline.

2. **Template-Based Approach:** These tools provide pre-defined templates or code snippets for common pipeline tasks, such as building, testing, deploying, and monitoring. Users can select and customize these templates to meet their specific requirements.

3. **Automation and Validation:** They can automatically validate pipeline configurations, checking for errors and suggesting corrections in real-time, which helps prevent issues that could lead to pipeline failures.

4. **Integration:** Many pipeline syntax generators integrate with popular CI/CD platforms, allowing users to directly import or export pipeline configurations to and from their CI/CD systems.

5. **Version Control:** Some generators offer version control integration, allowing users to store and track changes to their pipeline configurations within a version control system (e.g., Git).

6. **Documentation:** They often provide documentation or tooltips to help users understand the purpose and usage of different pipeline configuration elements.

By using a pipeline syntax generator, development and operations teams can streamline the process of defining, configuring, and maintaining CI/CD pipelines. This is especially beneficial for those who may not have deep expertise in writing pipeline scripts from scratch or for organizations looking to standardize their pipeline configuration process.

While specific pipeline syntax generators vary in terms of features and capabilities, they are generally designed to simplify the creation and management of CI/CD pipelines, making the adoption of CI/CD practices more accessible to a broader range of teams and individuals.

### Required sections in the pipeline configuration. A pipeline configuration has three required sections. Agent, stages, at least one stage and at least one step. why required? what does each section do?

In the context of a software development or automation pipeline, a pipeline configuration typically consists of several sections to define how the pipeline operates. The three required sections you mentioned, "agent," "stages," and at least one "stage" with at least one "step," are essential for defining the structure and behavior of the pipeline. Let's break down each of these sections:

1. Agent:
   - Purpose and Importance: The "agent" section defines where and how the pipeline will be executed. It specifies the environment and resources required for running the pipeline, such as the type of machine, operating system, and any special configurations.
   - Sample Agent Section:
     ```yaml
     agent:
       machine:
         type: some-machine-type
         os: linux
       docker:
         image: my-custom-image:latest
     ```

2. Stages:
   - Purpose and Importance: The "stages" section defines the high-level phases or steps of the pipeline. Each stage represents a distinct set of tasks or activities that are logically grouped together. Stages help in breaking down the pipeline into manageable and organized parts.
   - Sample Stages Section:
     ```yaml
     stages:
       - build
       - test
       - deploy
     ```

3. Stage(s) with at least one Step:
   - Purpose and Importance: Each "stage" contains one or more "steps." A "step" represents a specific task or action within a stage, such as compiling code, running tests, or deploying an application. Steps define the actual work to be done in the pipeline.
   - Sample Stage(s) and Steps:
     ```yaml
     stages:
       - build:
           steps:
             - checkout: git
             - run: npm install
       - test:
           steps:
             - run: npm test
             - publish: test-results
       - deploy:
           steps:
             - deploy: production
     ```

The purpose of these required sections is to provide a clear and structured way to define how the pipeline should run, where it should run, and what tasks it should perform. Having these sections ensures that the pipeline is well-organized and can be easily understood, maintained, and scaled as needed.

The actual syntax and structure may vary depending on the pipeline configuration language or tool you're using (e.g., YAML for configuration files in tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions), but the fundamental concepts of an "agent," "stages," and "steps" are generally consistent across most pipeline systems.

### Embeddable

The term "embeddable" refers to something that can be easily inserted or integrated into something else. It is often used in the context of technology and software to describe components, widgets, or code that can be seamlessly added to a website, application, or system. These embeddable elements are designed to work within the existing framework, providing specific functionality or content without requiring extensive modification of the host system.

For example, an "embeddable video player" is a video player that can be easily inserted into a webpage by pasting a snippet of code, allowing the website to display and play videos without the need for custom programming. Similarly, an "embeddable map" might refer to a map widget that can be added to a website to display location information without building a map from scratch.

The concept of embeddability is not limited to technology and can be applied to various fields where something can be integrated or inserted into another system or environment with minimal effort.

### Build Triggers

In Jenkins, build triggers are actions or events that initiate the execution of a Jenkins job or pipeline. There are various types of build triggers in Jenkins, and you can configure them to start a job automatically when specific conditions are met. Here are some common build triggers in Jenkins:

1. **SCM (Source Code Management) Trigger**: This trigger starts a build when changes are detected in the version control system (e.g., Git, Subversion). It's a common choice for continuous integration.

2. **Scheduled Trigger**: You can set up jobs to run at specific times or on a recurring schedule, using the "Build periodically" option in the job configuration.

3. **Upstream/Downstream Projects Trigger**: Jobs can trigger other jobs based on their success or failure. For example, you can configure a downstream job to start when an upstream job completes successfully.

4. **Webhook Trigger**: Jenkins can be integrated with other systems, and webhooks can be set up to start a Jenkins job when an external event occurs, such as a code repository push.

5. **Manual Trigger**: You can configure a job to be triggered manually by users. This is useful when human intervention is required before a build or deployment.

To set up a build trigger in Jenkins, follow these general steps:

1. **Create or Configure a Jenkins Job**: If you don't have a job already, create a new one or configure an existing job that you want to trigger.

2. **Configure Build Triggers**:
   - For SCM triggers, you would specify the repository URL and polling schedule.
   - For scheduled triggers, use the "Build periodically" option.
   - For upstream/downstream triggers, specify the related projects in the job configuration.
   - For webhooks, configure the external system to send a webhook to your Jenkins server, and set up a Jenkins job to listen for the webhook event.

3. **Save and Apply**: Save your job configuration after setting up the build trigger.

When the specified trigger conditions are met, Jenkins will automatically start the job or pipeline.

Remember that Jenkins provides a wide range of plugins, and the exact steps to set up build triggers may vary depending on the plugins you have installed and the specific requirements of your project. It's important to refer to Jenkins documentation and any relevant plugin documentation for detailed and up-to-date instructions.
